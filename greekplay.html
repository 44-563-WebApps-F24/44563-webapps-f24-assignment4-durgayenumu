    <h2>King Oedipus by Sophocles</h2>

    <p><h4>Oedipus:</h4> What is this secret? Let me know at once!</p>
    <p><h4>Jocasta:</h4> Please, Oedipus, no! In heaven's name, don't ask!</p>
    <p><h4>Oedipus:</h4> I must know, no matter how dark the truth may be.</p>
    <p><h4>Jocasta:</h4> Then, I will speak. You were born to Laius.</p>
    <p><h4>Oedipus:</h4> My father? But... what of the prophecy?</p>
    <p><h4>Jocasta:</h4> It is true. The prophecy said you would kill him and marry your mother.</p>
    <p><h4>Oedipus:</h4> Oh, gods! My curse is fulfilled!</p>

    <p>_Jocasta rushes out, grief-stricken._</p>
