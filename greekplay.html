    <p><strong>Oedipus:</strong> What is this secret? Let me know at once!</p>
    <p><strong>Jocasta:</strong> Please, Oedipus, no! In heaven's name, don't ask!</p>
    <p><strong>Oedipus:</strong> I must know, no matter how dark the truth may be.</p>
    <p><strong>Jocasta:</strong> Then, I will speak. You were born to Laius.</p>
    <p><strong>Oedipus:</strong> My father? But... what of the prophecy?</p>
    <p><strong>Jocasta:</strong> It is true. The prophecy said you would kill him and marry your mother.</p>
    <p><strong>Oedipus:</strong> Oh, gods! My curse is fulfilled!</p>
